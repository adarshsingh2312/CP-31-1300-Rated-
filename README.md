# CP-31: 1300-Rated Problems

Solutions for 1300-rated problems from the [CP-31 Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet).

This repository is a personal record of solved problems and a place to practice competitive programming consistently.

## Language

- C++17

## Repository Structure

Each problem has a C++ source file named after the problem:

```text
problemName.cpp
```

Examples:

```text
strangeBdayParty.cpp
strongVertices.cpp
```

## Compile and Run

Compile a solution with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra problemName.cpp -o problemName
```

Run it with:

```bash
./problemName
```

On macOS, you can also use `clang++`:

```bash
clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra problemName.cpp -o problemName
```

## Progress

The repository will be updated as more 1300-rated CP-31 problems are solved.

## Commit Convention

Use one commit for each solved problem:

```text
feat: solve Codeforces <problem-id> - <problem-name>
```

Example:

```text
feat: solve Codeforces 1470A - Strange Birthday Party
```
